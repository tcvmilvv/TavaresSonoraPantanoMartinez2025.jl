EH-1 contains one positively charged lysine and several hydrophobic residues (Phe, Thr, and Tyr) showing significant interactions with  the membrane, consistently with a surface-bound amphipathic helix stabilized by complementary hydrophobic–polar interactions. EH-2 is remarkable for containing a single tryptophan that interacts with the lipids.  The indole moiety of Trp is well suited to engage in hydrogen bonding via the pyrrole NH. EH-3, while also amphipathic, contains a larger proportion of hydrophobic residues (Phe, Leu, Ile, and His), together with neutral polar residues (Asn and Gln) interacting with the lipid bilayer. This dual composition likely supports surface association, with lipid binding dominated by aromatic Phe residues. In all three EH helices, POC interactions appear consistent with its neutral but bulky polar head, which can engage both hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices and polar residues exposed at the surface. The ET helices adopt a transmembrane orientation, favoring extensive contacts with hydrophobic residues, as shown in Figures S29-37d and e. ET-1 is stabilized by two tryptophans at the interface, acting as orientational anchors through interactions with headgroups and the glycerol backbone. Additional contributions from Phe within the aromatic belt strengthen this interfacial positioning, while deeper hydrophobic contacts involve Thr, Met, Leu, and Ile. ET-2 also displays transmembrane character, with interactions dominated by hydrophobic residues (Cys, Leu, Phe, and Gly). The presence of serine, a neutral polar residue, at the interface suggests possible stabilization through headgroup contacts.","category":"page"},{"location":"figures/","page":"Supplementary Figures","title":"Supplementary Figures","text":"The MH helices exhibit complementary contributions from both aromatic and hydrophobic residues (Figures S29-37f, g, and h). Residues Tyr, Trp, His, and Phe, in the MH-1, interact considerably with the lipid bilayer. This suggests a cooperative role of aromatic belt residues and electrostatic contributions in orienting MH-1. MH-2 is more deeply embedded, dominated by hydrophobic interactions (Leu, Pro, Phe, Gly, Ile, and Ala). Here, Phe residues may still play a role at the interfacial boundary. MH-3 also behaves as a transmembrane segment, with hydrophobic residues (Thr, Tyr, Val, and Ile) providing the main contribution, while polar residues Ser and Gln establish complementary interactions with headgroups.","category":"page"},{"location":"figures/","page":"Supplementary Figures","title":"Supplementary Figures","text":"EH-1 and EH-3 are both amphipathic α-helices with moderate hydrophobicity (0.32 and 0.58, respectively) and relatively high hydrophobic moments, suggesting favorable interactions with the interfacial region of the bilayer. These characteristics are consistent with their roles in membrane association without full bilayer penetration. Coordination with both headgroup and glycerol beads from the membrane was observed in these regions, particularly in EH-3, which displayed strong and spatially organized lipid interactions. The amphipathic nature of EH-1 and EH-3 enables these helices to align parallel to the bilayer surface, as supported by their horizontal orientation and their distribution of polar and nonpolar residues, facilitating both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts with the lipid interface. This is in agreement with studies showing that surface-bound amphipathic helices contribute to viral protein reorganization during membrane fusion and particle maturation.","category":"page"},{"location":"figures/","page":"Supplementary Figures","title":"Supplementary Figures","text":"EH-2, also amphipathic, exhibits unique interfacial behavior. This helix is characterized by a dominant tryptophan residue (Trp429), which appears to act as a membrane anchor. The preference for interaction with lipid headgroups in this region (particularly from POPE and POPC) is consistent with previous findings that aromatic residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine are frequently enriched at membrane interfaces due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds and cation–π interactions with phosphate or choline groups[1]. The spatial localization of Trp429 at the interface may confer structural stabilization at the bilayer boundary, possibly influencing conformational transitions in the viral envelope during fusion.","category":"page"},{"location":"figures/","page":"Supplementary Figures","title":"Supplementary Figures","text":"ET-1 and ET-2 are strongly hydrophobic helices (hydrophobicity > 1.1) with low hydrophobic moments, indicating uniform distribution of nonpolar residues and suggesting full transmembrane insertion. These helices display robust coordination with the hydrophobic tail beads of POPC and POPE, in line with their vertical orientation within the membrane. Residues such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, and methionine contribute significantly to lipid interactions in these domains. This is consistent with structural studies reporting that aromatic residues at the midplane or termini of TM helices stabilize bilayer integration by reducing local bilayer perturbation and promoting favorable lipid packing[2].","category":"page"},{"location":"figures/","page":"Supplementary Figures","title":"Supplementary Figures","text":"The MH-1 segment of the M protein is characterized by a high hydrophobic moment and a balanced proportion of polar and nonpolar residues. The helical wheels (Figures S29-37f) show a distribution of side chains compatible with interfacial alignment, and residues such as Tyr25, His28, Trp35, and Phe37 dominate its lipid interaction profile. These features suggest that MH-1 acts similarly to an amphipathic helix aligned parallel to the membrane surface, where it engages primarily with lipid headgroups and the glycerol backbone.
