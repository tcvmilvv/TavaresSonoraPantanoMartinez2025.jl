# Supplementary Figures

This section provides detailed visualizations of the key findings from our coarse-grained simulation study of the Zika virus. These plots are organized to facilitate understanding of the lipid-protein interactions analyses.

For easy reference:

* Protein–Lipid Coordination Overview: Structural maps and Hammer–Aitoff projections showing global lipid contact frequencies across the E–M complex, revealing asymmetric preferences for POPE and POPS between outer and inner leaflets.

* Lipid Spatial Distribution: Two-dimensional density maps illustrating coordination number differences between lipid pairs (POPC, POPE, and POPS) across individual protein chains (K, L, M, N, O, P), highlighting localized lipid enrichment and domain-specific preferences.

* Residue-Level Lipid Interactions: Normalized lipid contact profiles centered on lysine residues in selected chains, illustrating residue-specific solvation patterns and lipid-type selectivity.

* Subunit-Resolved Lipid Contributions: Comparative 2D density maps displaying the spatial organization of lipid beads from POPC, POPE, and POPS around EH, ET, and MH subunits, providing insight into domain-level interaction patterns.

* Helical Orientation and Hydrophobic Moment Analysis: Helical wheel representations for all envelope and membrane protein chains, mapping lipid contributions within 5 Å and visualizing the orientation of hydrophobic moments relative to the membrane.
